# 10 Academy Week 0 Final Report

## 📌 Project Objective
Brief explanation of MoonLight Energy Solutions' goal and your role in analyzing solar data across Benin, Togo, and Sierra Leone.

## ✅ Task 1: Git & Environment Setup
- Created repo `solar-challenge-week1`
- Set up Python environment and CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Project structure organized for collaboration

## 📊 Task 2: Data Profiling, Cleaning & EDA
- Cleaned and analyzed datasets for:
  - **Benin** (`benin-malanville.csv`)
  - **Togo** (`togo-dapaong_qc.csv`)
  - **Sierra Leone** (`sierraleone-bumbuna.csv`)
- Performed EDA with outlier handling, time series plots, correlation heatmaps
- Exported cleaned files

## 🌍 Task 3: Cross-Country Comparison
- Compared GHI, DNI, and DHI using boxplots and statistical tests
- Found Benin had highest average GHI
- ANOVA results: significant difference between countries (p < 0.05)

## 🖥️ Bonus: Streamlit Dashboard
- Built interactive dashboard to explore data by country and metric
- Includes summary statistics and dynamic plots
- Link to app (if deployed) or instructions to run locally

## 🚀 Lessons Learned
- Hands-on with Git, CI/CD, EDA, and dashboards
- Improved data storytelling and collaboration
